This program simulates a game of tic tac toe. The functions create a new 3x3 board of chars initiated with '-'. 
The program supports turns by taking in user input and updates the baord accordingly.
It then displays the board after each new move.

To run: use the main.exe execuatble file or compile the TicTacToe.cpp file yourself with:
 g++ TicTacToe.cpp -o main
 ./main
